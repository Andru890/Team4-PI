## Version Support

### Note!
This SDK is cross-platform, but only the Node.js versions are worth mentioning

| SDK Version   | Node.js 10    | Node.js 12  | Node.js 14   | Node.js 16  |
|---------------|------------|----------|----------|----------|
|  1.x          | V          | V        | V        | V        |



## Installation
### Install using your favorite package manager (yarn, npm)
```bash
npm install @cloudinary/transformation-builder-sdk
```
```bash
yarn add @cloudinary/transformation-builder-sdk
```

## Usage
### Setup
```javascript
// Import the Cloudinary class
import {Transformation} from '@cloudinary/transformation-builder-sdk';

// Create your transformation
const tx = new Transformation()
        .resize(scale(100, 100))
```

### Transform and Optimize Assets
- [See full documentation](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/javascript_image_transformations)
```javascript
// Create a new instance if you haven't (see above for the details)
const cld = new Cloudinary({/*...*/})

// Let's create a new image
const myImage = cld.image('sample');

// Import the resize transformation and apply it to myImage
import {Resize} from '@cloudinary/url-gen/actions/resize';

// Resize the image to 100x100
myImage.resize(Resize.scale().width(100).height(100));

// When we're done, we can apply all our changes and create a URL.
const myURL = myImage.toURL();

// https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/c_scale,w_100,h_100/sample
console.log(myURL);
```

### Transpilation
`@cloudinary/transformation-builder-sdk` is shipped as untranspiled ES6 code.
`@cloudinary/transformation-builder-sdk` is optimized around bundle size, as such we do not transpile our distributed modules,
we leave the decision of what browsers to support, and what transpilations to apply, to you, the user.

### Testing with Jest
As mentioned above, we're shipping `@cloudinary/transformation-builder-sdk` with ES6 code, as this provides great tree-shaking potential.
it also requires a few adjustments when testing.

In jest.config, you'll need to add these lines to allow babel to transpile our code.
```json
{
  "transform": {
    "node_modules/@cloudinary/transformation-builder-sdk": "babel-jest"
  },
  "transformIgnorePatterns": ["/node_modules/(?!@cloudinary/transformation-builder-sdk)"]
}
```
Make sure to install babel-jest:
`npm install babel-jest`

You'll also need to ensure you have a `babel.config.js` file (and not a `.babelrc`), and that
it's configured properly to transpile code,

*As an example*:
```js
module.exports = {
  "presets": [
    "@babel/preset-env"
  ]
};
```
